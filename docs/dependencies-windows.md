# Dependencies for Windows

## System Requirements

We develop the Windows version of Pupil using **64 bit** **Windows 10**.

Therefore we can only debug and support issues for **Windows 10**.

## Notes Before Starting

### 64 Bit
You should be using a 64 bit system and therefore all downloads, builds, and libraries should be for `x64` unless otherwise specified.

### System Environment Variables

You will need to check to see that Python was added to your system PATH variables. You will also need to manually add other entries to the system PATH later in the setup process.

To access your System Environment Variables:

- Right click on the Windows icon in the system tray.
- Select `System`.
- Click on `Advanced system settings`.
- Click on `Environment Variables...`.
- You can click on `Path` in `System Variables` to view the variables that have been set.
- You can `Edit` or `Add` new paths (this is needed later in the setup process).

### Help

For discussion or questions on Windows head over to our [#pupil Discord channel](https://discord.gg/gKmmGqy). If you run into trouble please raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil)!

## 7-Zip
Install [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract files.

## Python

You will need a **64 bit version** of Python 3.6, e.g. download [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.8/python-3.6.8-amd64.exe). If you install any other version, make sure to install the **64 bit version!**

**NOTE:** Currently our build process for WIndows does not yet support Python 3.7 as pyaudio does not yet have prebuild wheels for Windows available for Python 3.7. You are thus highly encouraged to use the latest stable version of Python 3.6.

If you downloaded the linked installer:

- Run the Python installer.
- Check the box `Add Python to PATH`. This will add Python to your System PATH Environment Variable.
- Check the box `Install for all users`. **Note:** By default this will install Python to `C:\Program Files\Python36`. Some build scripts may fail to start Python due to spaces in the path name. So, you may want to consider installing Python to `C:\Python36` instead.


## Install Python Libraries

We recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for running Pupil.

```sh
# Upgrade pip to latest version. This is necessary for some dependencies.
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install cython
pip install msgpack==0.5.6
pip install numexpr
pip install opencv-python==3.*
pip install packaging
pip install psutil
pip install pyaudio
pip install pyopengl
pip install pyzmq
pip install scipy
pip install win_inet_pton
pip install git+https://github.com/zeromq/pyre

pip install pupil-apriltags
pip install pupil-detectors
```

## Pupil Labs Python Wheels

In addition to these libraries, you will need to install some Pupil-Labs support libraries. Since building them for Windows is also not automated yet, we provide some prebuilt wheels that you can use. If you want to build the support libraries yourself as well, you will have to look for install instructions on the respective GitHub repositories.

Download the following Python wheels from Pupil Labs github repos:

- [pyglui](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyglui/releases/latest)
- [pyav](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyav/releases/latest)
- [pyndsi](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/releases/latest)
- [pyuvc](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyuvc/releases/latest)

`pyuvc` requires that you download Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable from [microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632). The `pthreadVC2` lib, which is used by libuvc, depends on `msvcr100.dll`.

Open your command prompt and `Run as administrator` in the directory where the wheels are downloaded.

- Install all wheels with `pip install X` (where X is the name of the `.whl` file)
- You can check that libs are installed with `python import X` statements in the command prompt where `X` is the name of the lib.

## Modifying Pupil to Work with Windows

Before you can start using Pupil from source on Windows, you will have to make a few additional changes to the repository.

### Clone Pupil Repository

Open a command prompt where you want to clone the git repository, e.g. `C:\work\pupil`
Make sure you don't have spaces in your path to the repository as this has been repeatedly causing issues for users.
Then run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil.git
```

### Include pupil_external in PATH Variable

- Follow the instructions under the System Environment Variables section above to add a new environment variable to PATH
- Add the full path to the `pupil_external` folder of the repository that you just cloned, e.g. `C:\work\pupil\pupil_external`
- You might have to restart your computer so that the PATH variable is refreshed

### Setup pupil_external Dependencies
The following steps require you to store dynamic libraries in the `pupil_external` folder of the cloned repository so that you do not have to add further modifications to your system PATH.

#### GLEW

- Download GLEW Windows binaries from [sourceforge](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- Unzip GLEW in your work dir
- Copy `glew32.dll` to `pupil_external`

#### GLFW

- Download GLFW Windows binaries from [glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Unzip GLFW to your work dir
- Copy `glfw3.dll` from `lib-vc2015` to `pupil_external`

#### FFMPEG

- Download FFMPEG v4.0 Windows shared binaries from [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
- Unzip ffmpeg-shared to your work dir
- Copy the following 8 `.dll` files to `pupil_external`
    - `avcodec-58.dll`
    - `avdevice-58.dll`
    - `avfilter-7.dll`
    - `avformat-58.dll`
    - `avutil-56.dll`
    - `postproc-55.dll`
    - `swresample-3.dll`
    - `swscale-5.dll`

## Start Pupil

To start either of the applications -- Capture, Player, or Service -- you can to execute the respective `run_*.bat` file (e.g. by double clicking), i.e. `run_capture.bat`, `run_player.bat`, or `run_service.bat`.

```powershell
cd pupil_src
run_capture.bat
# or run_player.bat
# or run_service.bat
```

You can also run `main.py` directly from your IDE or command line. Make sure that the `pupil_external` folder is part of your system path.
```sh
cd pupil_src
python main.py capture # or player/service
```
